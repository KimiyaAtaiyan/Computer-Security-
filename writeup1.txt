For this problem I went based on the article and the given code example.
We want to create a sandbox in order to taint some values. 
For this part we are not actually validating the data which is why we are only using UNSAFE_verified() for the callback function of on_completion.
This only unwraps the tainted value, without actually verifying it.

Because we are working with strings, we have to allocate memory in the sandbox and later on free that memory and destroy the sandbox.
